# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-28)

**Core value:** A visitor is visually impressed and reaches "Abrir Ticket" on Discord, while staff keep gallery/catalog current without touching code.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — foundation-bilingual-shell

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (foundation-bilingual-shell) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 4
Status: Plan 01-02 implementation tasks (1-2) complete and committed to `revamp` (7484f2a, 35c71ce). PAUSED at the Task 3 human-verify checkpoint (gate=blocking) — global chrome built, awaiting user verification of the running site before finalizing. Pages Source cutover + push of `revamp` still pending (user action).
Last activity: 2026-06-28 -- Plan 01-02 impl done (nav/switcher/CTA/modal/footer); paused at human-verify

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Astro (static) over framework/vanilla — keeps GitHub Pages + bot-commit flow
- [Roadmap]: Motion split into its own phase (Phase 2) — substantial enough (WebGL + Lenis + GSAP + View Transitions + cursor) to verify independently
- [Roadmap]: Bot cog (Phase 5) is cross-repo in `nocturna-bot`; hard-depends on Phase 4's finalized `gallery.json` schema
- [Roadmap]: i18n established in Phase 1 so all later content is bilingual from the start
- [Phase ?]: [01-01] Pinned Astro 7.0.3 (not 5.x) — only npm-audit-clean version; satisfies supply-chain mitigation T-01-SC (0 vulns)

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- [Phase 1] Terms EN translation needs human/legal review before publishing (I18N-04).
- [Phase 1] Image storage path (`assets/gallery/` vs `public/gallery/`) must be decided this phase — feeds Phase 4 schema and Phase 5 bot.
- [Phase 3] Modular catalog prices not yet agreed by team → render as "Cotizar" until decided.
- [Phase 5] Requires GitHub PAT/deploy key in the bot's `.env` for cross-repo push.
- [Doc] REQUIREMENTS.md footer originally said "27 v1"; actual v1 count is 30 (PLAT 4 + I18N 4 + NAV 4 + FX 4 + CAT 4 + GAL 4 + BOT 6). Coverage corrected to 30/30.
